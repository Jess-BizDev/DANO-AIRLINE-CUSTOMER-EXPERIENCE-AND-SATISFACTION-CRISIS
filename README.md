![A strategic analysis](Cover%20Photo.png)

## A strategic analysis to investigate why passenger satisfaction rates has fallen to 43.4% and provide a data-backed strategy to restore the Dano Airline’s reputation.

## 1.0 Executive Summary
Our analysis of 129,000+ passengers shows that Dano Airlines does not have a "general" problem. Instead, we are seeing a massive divide between two different types of customers. While our Business Class is a high-performing success (69% satisfaction), our Economy Class is in a state of crisis (18.7% satisfaction).
Because Economy passengers make up the majority of our flights, their poor experience is the primary reason the overall satisfaction rate has dipped below 50%. This report identifies the "Economy Trap," "Digital Friction," and the "Loyalty Paradox" as the three areas we must fix.

## 2.0 Data Cleaning & Tools
To ensure these findings were accurate, we performed a thorough data cleanup (ETL process):
1.	Cleaning: We fixed missing values in the "Arrival Delay" column so that small delays wouldn't look worse than they were.
2.	Custom Metrics: We created special formulas (DAX) to track Loyalty and Satisfaction Rates automatically.
3.	Interactive Tools: We built "Global Slicers" (buttons for Class, Travel Type, and Loyalty) so that management can filter the data with one click to see exactly where the problems are.

## 3.0 Root Cause Analysis: The "Economy Trap"
The biggest reason for the satisfaction dip is the sheer volume of unhappy passengers in the back of the plane.
1.	The Volume Gap: Economy and Economy Plus make up 55% of our total passengers.
2.	The Personal Travel Conflict: Our data shows that Personal Travelers (vacationers) are our most dissatisfied group. Why? Because 93.3% of them pay out of their own pockets for Economy seats.
3.	The Result: Since our Economy service is failing, we are consistently letting down the "Personal Travel" segment, which represents the heart of our repeat business.
