## 1.0 Executive Summary
Our analysis of 129,000+ passengers shows that Dano Airlines does not have a "general" problem. Instead, we are seeing a massive divide between two different types of customers. While our Business Class is a high-performing success (69% satisfaction), our Economy Class is in a state of crisis (18.7% satisfaction).
Because Economy passengers make up the majority of our flights, their poor experience is the primary reason the overall satisfaction rate has dipped below 50%. This report identifies the "Economy Trap," "Digital Friction," and the "Loyalty Paradox" as the three areas we must fix.

## 2.0 Data Cleaning & Tools
To ensure these findings were accurate, we performed a thorough data cleanup (ETL process):
1.	Cleaning: We fixed missing values in the "Arrival Delay" column so that small delays wouldn't look worse than they were.
2.	Custom Metrics: We created special formulas (DAX) to track Loyalty and Satisfaction Rates automatically.
3.	Interactive Tools: We built "Global Slicers" (buttons for Class, Travel Type, and Loyalty) so that management can filter the data with one click to see exactly where the problems are.

## 3.0 Root Cause Analysis: The "Economy Trap"
The biggest reason for the satisfaction dip is the sheer volume of unhappy passengers in the back of the plane.
1.	The Volume Gap: Economy and Economy Plus make up 55% of our total passengers.
2.	The Personal Travel Conflict: Our data shows that Personal Travelers (vacationers) are our most dissatisfied group. Why? Because 93.3% of them pay out of their own pockets for Economy seats.
3.	The Result: Since our Economy service is failing, we are consistently letting down the "Personal Travel" segment, which represents the heart of our repeat business.

### 3.1 The Service Matrix: Ranking the Problems (Lowest to Highest)
We ranked every service from the lowest rated to the highest. This "Pain Point List" shows exactly where Dano Airlines is losing its passengers.

![Service Ratings](Service%20Ratings%20Matrix.png)
#### Legend:

🔵 Blue: Represents Satisfied passengers (Success Zone).
🔴 Red: Represents Neutral or Dissatisfied passengers (Risk Zone).

_Note: Conditional formatting in the Service Matrix highlights scores below 3.0 in Red to identify immediate operational priorities._
### The Red Zone
Inflight Wifi Service, Online Booking, and Boarding are low across all classes. This means our digital experience is frustrating everyone, regardless of whether they paid for a Business or Economy ticket.

### 3.2 Demographic Insights: Who is most unhappy?
When we look at age groups, we see a clear pattern:
1.	Seniors (65+): They report low satisfaction because the Online Booking and Boarding processes are too complicated.
2.	Gen Z / Teens (Under 18): Their scores are low because the Wifi is unreliable. For this generation, a lack of connectivity is a major dealbreaker.

### 3.3 The Loyalty Paradox
We found that 99% of unhappy Personal Travelers are "Returning Customers." 
The Reality is that they aren't returning because they are happy but because they feel "trapped" by frequent flyer miles or a lack of other flight options.
-	The Danger: This is a "ticking time bomb." If a competitor enters our market with better Economy seats or a better app, these customers will leave us immediately because there is no emotional brand loyalty.

## 4.0 Data-Driven Recommendations & Action Plan for Dano Airlines
#### 1. Eliminate Digital Friction 
The digital experience (Online Booking and Boarding) is the first impression a customer has. Our "First-time" fliers are much unhappier than returning ones, proving that the website/app is scaring away new business.
#### Action Plan
Simplify the online booking interface and streamline the boarding process to reduce "pre-flight stress."

#### 2. The Economy Wi-Fi Overhaul
Since Wi-Fi is the #1 complaint across all classes, we must change our strategy.
#### Action Plan  
Offer "Freemium" Wi-Fi services for everyone on board. This turns a major point of frustration into a valuable proposition for the 99% of loyal personal travelers.

#### 3. Solve the Economy Trap
The Matrix reveals that Economy passengers are uniquely unhappy across five specific touchpoints: Wi-Fi, Seat Comfort, In-flight Entertainment, Online Boarding and Booking. This indicates that the Economy "product" is viewed as a commodity rather than a service.
#### Action Plan
Re-design the Economy "Value Proposition." Small investments in seat ergonomics and an upgraded digital entertainment library can bridge the comfort gap without the massive cost of full cabin overhauls.  This will significantly improve the satisfaction of our highest-volume customer base.

#### 4. Resolve the Loyalty Paradox
The Loyalty Paradox (82% of customers return despite being unhappy) is a ticking time bomb. This loyalty is likely based on Frequent Flyer miles or lack of regional competition.
#### Action Plan
We cannot rely on "forced loyalty." We must launch a "Service Recovery" campaign targeted at our Returning-Dissatisfied segment. By offering "Welcome Back" incentives that include a free "Economy Plus" upgrade or priority boarding, we can re-establish an emotional connection with our most frequent fliers before a competitor enters our hub.

## 5.0 Conclusion
Dano Airlines has a broken Economy experience. By fixing the digital "friction" and improving the basic comfort for Economy passengers, the airline can easily recover its satisfaction rate and protect its loyal customer base from competitors.
